Artist Tracker is an app that helps you keep track of your favorite artists. In
the future, hopefully it will also be able to display your artist's tour schedule

Technologies used: ruby, ruby on rails

unsolved problems: no problems per se but there are features that I was hoping
to add that I was unable to. One would be displaying concerts for the user's
selected artists, the other one would be also displaying a link to purchase
tickets for those concerts.

Planning:
My 1:1 was very helpful with setting up a schedule for myself which I was actually
able to stick to. It also helped me set more realistic goals for my project as my
initial idea was a little too ambitious. I started with working on the API and making
sure everything worked on the backend before I focused on front-end authorization. The
last part of the project I worked on was CSS.


My strategy for solving problems mainly involved the issue queue, google and stack overflow. If I wan't able to find an answer to a problem I was having on google or SO, I would check the issue queue and see if anyone was having a similar problem. If I couldn't find it there, I would then submit a new issue.
